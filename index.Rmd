## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... abortion, birth rates, and miscarriages inmTexas 

How do abortion rates compare to birth rates and miscarriage rates in California and Texas? 
California is a consistent Democrat state and Texas is a consistent Republican State


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
head(NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse)

abortion_and_mis <- NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse |>
  select(state, year, abortionratelt20: abortionrate40plus, miscarriageslt20: miscarriages40plus)
head(abortion_and_births)


CA_abortion_and_mis <- abortion_and_mis |>
  subset(state == "CA")
CA_abortion_and_mis
```
## Abortion Plot

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(broom)


CAabort_plot <- CA_abortion_and_mis |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = abortionrate2024)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year))

```
## Miscarriage Plot

```{r}

CAmis_plot <- CA_abortion_and_mis |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = miscarriages2024)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year))

```
