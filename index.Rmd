## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... abortion, birth rates, and miscarriages inmTexas 

How do abortion rates compare to birth rates and miscarriage rates in California and Texas? 
California is a consistent Democrat state and Texas is a consistent Republican State


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
head(NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse)

abortion_and_births <- NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse |>
  select(state, year, abortionratelt20: abortionrate40plus, birthratelt15: birthrate40plus)
head(abortion_and_births)


CA_abortion_and_births <- abortion_and_births |>
  subset(state == "CA")
CA_abortion_and_births
```
## Plotting birth rates

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

CA_abortion_and_births |>
  gglot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = abortionrate2024)) + geom_point()

```
